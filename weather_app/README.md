# shellscripting
repo for all the shell scripting projects <br>
Hi Folks this is a small project to learn shell scripting <br>
this project used weather api to collect the real time weather information the api provides the data in json format so in order to process and format it we use jq package <br>
use  <b>"sudo apt-get install jq" </b>. <br>
install the jq package <br>
generate the api key from weather.api (https://www.weatherapi.com/) and use it in the script.<br>
